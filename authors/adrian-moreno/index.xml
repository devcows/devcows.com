By default, Mikrotik does not allow to use FQDN (domain names) to setup an IPsec tunnel, so we are going to create some scripts to update the IPsec configuration whenever the local or remote IPs change.
The network layout is as follows:

And you may not use other repositories since they will probably not provide packages for ARM devices such as the Raspberry PI.
There are different reasons for updating Deluge to the latest version. One of them is that 1.3.3 does not support Magnet links, which is a very common way of loading in torrents to the client.</description></item></channel></rss>
